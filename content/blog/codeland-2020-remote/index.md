CodeLand is a community conference by [DEV](https://codelandconf.com/) and [CodeNewbies](https://www.codenewbie.org/). It is usually a two-day in-person conference that takes place in New York city.

This year (2020), due to the pandemic of COVID-19, the conference took place online allowing many people outside US to attend. I was so lucky to attend it for the first time.

The goal of this year was **to level you up, from home!**

It was divided in two days of **inspiring talks and hands-on workshops from some of our industry's greatest teachers.**

# Talks

Around 12 hours of talks the first day (Thursday, July 23). Unfortunately I could not attend all of them, but ffortunatelythe replay is [available](https://dev.to/codeland).

Let's me just ssummarize for you 2 or 3 of them.

**Web Accessibility for Everyone** by Mirinda Limonczenko

Accessibility lets anyone use web apps without restriction. The speaker went through a study case to show us how they've built Guide the Dogs for the Blind website.

We have mainly discussed how to design both for visually impaired and for blind. For the first category the topics where:

- high color contrast,
- dramatic hover states
- option to raise contrast and text size

For the blind, the discussion was around screenreader software:

- organized and navigable menu architecture,
- elements grounded in context
- images to enrich the experience.

**The Art of Programming** by Erika Heidi

I liked this talk! The main discussing topic here was: "is programming a science or an art?"

# Workshops

The second day was dedicated for workshops. And it was not free, the [ticket](https://codelandconf.com/#tickets) was 25\$.

I'm sorry, but I can't talk much here as I did not attend. What I know is that it was well organized:

- possibility to attend two workshop
- 2.5 hours experiential sessions
- class size of no larger than 30 individuals.

# Attendees

Most of participants are from US, but what interrested me here was to see people around the world to join.

First of all myself from DRCongo, but also other from
