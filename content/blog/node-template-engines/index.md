Working with template engines will allow you to dynamically generate HTML markup with JavaScript for your different page in a Node app which does not make use of any frontend library or framework like [React](/vanillajs-react/) or Angular.

There are many options out there for quick templating. [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) and [EJS](https://ejs.co/) seem to be the most used. So, let's test them and if they're worth using. 
## Template Engines in a Nutshell

In a nutshell templates let us separate the HTML structure from the content contained within. They generally come with new syntax but are not at all difficult to work with. A little brush up in the docs will let you go.

You have templating systems in most other languages too. To name one, [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) is used in PHP world.
