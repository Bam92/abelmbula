Latex // is a typesetting system that is mostly used in scientific world.

# Why Use Latex?
You may be wondering why one should spend much time to use Latex rather than use a wordprocessing software like Google doc, MS Word...

Here are some points I think you should considere in order to get an answer to the question above:

- as dev, we usually want to keep track of our project
- as devs, we like to organize our project in a cool structure
- we like to see the magic happens by typing commands on CLI tools

Let's analyze each point.

**Track the project**

When I say *tracking*, I'm refering to the possibility to use Git and GitHub as they can allow us to keep snapshots of our resume. For instance, I can have three or four resumes in a projet: one that fit for front-end role with a focus on React, an other focuses on Angulas, an other for full stand, and the last one for back-end developer.

Yes, I know that you can do this with a wordprocessing software. So, Latex is not at all the winner for this point.
